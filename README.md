*Description*

Users can check the weather prediction for a specific location using the online application known as Weather app. React, a well-known JavaScript toolkit for creating user interfaces, is used to build the app, along with other cutting-edge web development tools including CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.  <br />

The search tab on the app allows users to specify a place, and the app will show the current weather conditions there. The app can also show extra data like humidity and wind speed.
